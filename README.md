# RFM_Analysis_using_Python
RFM Analysis is used to understand and segment customers based on their buying behaviour. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value, which are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.

- Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customersâ€™:
  1. recency (the date they made their last purchase)
  2. frequency (how often they make purchases)
  3. monetary value (the amount spent on purchases)

- Information on dataset and columns in datasets:
1. CustomerID - Unique identification key for each customer
2. PurchaseDate - Date on which purchase was made
3. TransactionAmount - Amount spend on the purchased product
4. ProductInformation - Name of the Product
5. OrderId - Unique identification key for each order
6. Location - Location/City name

Based on the data available, the respective key metrics (recency, frequency, Monetary value) are calculated and subsequent RFM analysis is performed to understand the customer behaviour.
